# Hand Written Digits 4 vs 9 Classification using SVM

This is my implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch (not using any libraries), and using it to distinguish 
between 28 x 28 images of hand-written digits "4" and "9" (the hardest pair to tell apart). I also implemented Stochastic Gradient 
Descent with momentum for optimization.

This is done for a project while taking a [machine learning course](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jlucas/teaching/csc411/) at University of Toronto.

## Results

With SGD momentum (Î²) = 0.1, SVM algorithm resulted in Training Accuracy of 0.9058 & Test Accuracy of 0.9039.
